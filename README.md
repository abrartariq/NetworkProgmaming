## Network Programming Homework Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to the homework assignments of a network programming course. The assignments cover topics such as HTTP, DNS, and reliable communication.

### Assignment-1

    In Homework 1, you will implement a basic HTTP/1.1 client that can send requests to web servers and display the responses. This will help you understand the basics of the HTTP protocol and how web clients interact with web servers.

### Assignment-2

    In Homework 2, you will learn to use Wireshark, a popular network protocol analyzer, to analyze and understand network traffic. You will analyze various protocols, including HTTP, TCP, DNS, and ICMP, and understand how they work together to facilitate communication over the internet.

### Assignment-3

    In Homework 3, you will code a recursive DNS resolver that can resolve domain names to IP addresses. This will help you understand the Domain Name System (DNS) and how it maps domain names to IP addresses.

### Assignment-4

    In Homework 4, you will learn to implement reliable communication between a client and server using Python sockets. You will implement a simple file transfer protocol that ensures reliable transfer of files over the network.

### Assignment-5

    In Homework 5, you will build upon the reliable communication protocol you implemented in Homework 4 and make it more robust by implementing flow control and congestion control mechanisms. This will help you understand the challenges in building reliable communication protocols and how they can be addressed.


In conclusion, these five assignments cover a range of important concepts in computer networking, from HTTP/1.1 protocols to reliable communication using Python.
